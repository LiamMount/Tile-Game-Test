# Tile Game Test
 An old test version of a game that myself and a few friends are still working on.
 
 The game will function similarly to games like Fire Emblem, Pit People, and other turn-based tiled strategy games. The old version seen here is lacking many features I plan to add in, however.
 
 // BIG NOTE! If you want all parts of this test to function correctly, you need to enable both the "Battle Display" game object and the "Menus" game object in the inspector! You can chalk this up to me not knowing any better a couple years ago. In current versions of this test, that issue does not exist. This project serves as a sort of starting point comparison.

This is an old version of the game that we were working on between late 2020 and early 2021. It taught me a lot about Unity, Game Dev, and Programming as a whole. It also has been good experience working on a small team, with six of us in all.

I am currently re-building the same test of the game, but from the ground up using many coding concepts I have learned over the past two years. I will commit that version to GitHub as well once I am done re-working the battle system. Through usage of inheritance, polymorphism, and static instances of classes, the new version of Project: Shlockmeisters does not feel like a wad of frozen spaghetti. Sorry about this ancient pasta though.
